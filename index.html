            Cooking salmon on the stovetop is the ultimate in 
            ease:if you don't want to heat ur oven or spend 
            too much time in front of it, sautéing a fillet 
            is the way to go. Or if you're looking for a damn 
            low-fat option, poaching of salmon produces fine
            tenders, clean-tasting fish.Salty: lower-sodium
            soy sauce, capers, miso, olive sweet: honey, brown
            sugar, maple syrup, orange juice or zest.Sour: fresh
            lemon, fresh lime, vinegar.Pungent: onion, shallot,
            garlic, ginger, horseradish, sesame.Creamy: cream 
            cheese, yogurt, crème fraîche, butter.

            If you choose boilingmethod, I recommend 
            boiling for 5 minutes, in rolling boil water.
            Steaming is a better method and I recommend 
            steaming in a steamer for 5 – 10 minutes. 
            The best method is oven baking. Crab is packed
            with protein, which is important for building 
            and maintaining muscle. Crab also contains high
            levels of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, and 
            selenium. </pre>

                Compared to other shellfish,the scallops are very
                easy to prepare for cooking!We usually just rinse
                them under cool running water and pat them dry.
                Check over them  as scallops you're handling them 
                and remove the side-muscle if you find any still,
                attached. Bright,buttery, delicate,and so tenders,
                I always make sure to order them when we visit a  
                restaurants serves fresh scallops.

                    Prawn fry recipe is a seafood dish to try out and 
                    prawns fry is shallow fried in a little bit of oil
                    and I must say the recipe turned out amazing. I 
                    basically, try my hands at fish and when I tried 
                    my hands on making prawn fry I was amazed at its 
                    taste.Many tend to cook prawns without cleaning
                    and removing the intestinal tract as it is not
                    extremely harmful but I would suggest removing 
                    them as it contains all the impurities which may
                    affect in the long run with regular consumption.
